# DappSociety Bounties

>**Everything in this repo is highly experimental**  
It is not secure to use any of this code in production (mainnet) until proper security audits have been conducted. It can result in irreversible loss of funds.

This repository contains DappSociety's implementation for bounties. Our goal is to use bounties, paid in native tokens, to bootstrap projects. The accompanying ERC-20 token interface can be [viewed here](https://github.com/DappSociety/token-contracts/tree/wip).

For a full background on the purpose and goals of this project, see [the whitepaper](./docs/whitepaper.md).

## Credits
Work on this project was inspired by [Bounties.Network](https://bounties.network) / [StandardBounties](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/StandardBounties). Although some core principles deviate from the standard bounties system, our goal is to collaborate and be compatible with them in the future.
