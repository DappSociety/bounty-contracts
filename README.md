# DappSociety Bounties

>**Everything in this repo is highly experimental**  
It is not secure to use any of this code in production (mainnet) until proper security audits have been conducted. It can result in irreversible loss of funds.

This repo contains DappSociety's implementation for bounties. Our goal is to use bounties, paid in native tokens, to bootstrap projects.
